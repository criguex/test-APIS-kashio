# Karate Kashio Automation 

Automation for basic flows as registration, login, purchase, and inquires of an online album sales system.

### Pre-requirements üìã

If you are a Java developer - Karate requires Java 11  and then either Maven, Gradle, Eclipse or IntelliJ to be installed. Note that Karate works fine on OpenJDK. Any Java version from 8-12 is supported.

If you are new to programming or test-automation, refer to this video for getting started with just the (free) IntelliJ Community Edition. Other options are the quickstart or the standalone executable.

If you don't want to use Java, you have the option of just downloading and extracting the ZIP release. Try this especially if you don't have much experience with programming or test-automation. We recommend that you use the Karate extension for Visual Studio Code - and with that, JavaScript, .NET and Python programmers will feel right at home.

Visual Studio Code can be used for Java (or Maven) projects as well. One reason to use it is the excellent debug support that we have for Karate.
